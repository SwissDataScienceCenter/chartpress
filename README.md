# chartpress

Automate building and publishing helm charts and associated images.

This is used as part of the JupyterHub and Binder projects.

Chartpress will:

- build docker images and tag them with the latest git commit
- publish those images to DockerHub
- rerender a chart to include the tagged images
- publish the chart and index to gh-pages

A `chartpress.yaml` file contains a specification of charts and images to build.

For example:

```yaml
charts:
  # list of charts by name
  # each name should be a directory containing a helm chart
  - name: binderhub
    # the prefix to use for built images
    imagePrefix: jupyterhub/k8s-
    # the git repo whose gh-pages contains the charts
    repo:
      git: jupyterhub/helm-chart
      published: https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart
    # additional paths (if any) relevant to the chart version
    # outside the chart directory itself
    paths:
      - ../setup.py
      - ../binderhub
    # images to build
    images:
      binderhub:
        # Context to send to docker build for use by the Dockerfile
        # (if different from the current directory)
        contextPath: ..
        # Dockerfile path, if different from the default
        # (may be needed if contextPath is set)
        dockerfilePath: images/binderhub/Dockerfile
        # path in values.yaml to be updated with image name and tag
        valuesPath: image
        # additional paths (if any) relevant to the image
        # outside the image directory itself
        paths:
          - ../setup.py
          - ../binderhub
```
